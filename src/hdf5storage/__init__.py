    `matlab_compatible` option. It makes sure that the file is

    installed third party plugins, as well as any user supplied or

    User marshallers must inherit from

    The priority with which marshallers are chosen (builtin, plugin, or

    from third party plugins, those supporting the higher Marshaller API
    versions take priority over those supporting lower versions.

    Parameters
    ----------
    load_plugins : bool, optional
        Whether to load marshallers from the third party plugins or
        not. Default is ``False``.
    lazy_loading : bool, optional
        Whether to attempt to load the required modules for each
        marshaller right away when added/given or to only do so when
        required (when marshaller is needed). Default is ``True``.
    priority : Sequence, optional
        3-element Sequence specifying the priority ordering (first has
        highest priority). The three elements must be ``'builtin'`` for
        the builtin marshallers included in this package, ``'plugin'``

        and ``'user'`` for marshallers provided to this class

class File(collections.abc.MutableMapping):
    """Wrapper that allows writing and reading data from an HDF5 file.

    Opens an HDF5 file for reading (and optionally writing) Python
    objects from/to. The ``close`` method must be called to close the
    file. This class supports context handling with the ``with``
    statement.

    Python objects are read and written from/to paths. Paths can be
    given directly as POSIX style ``str`` or ``bytes``, as
    ``pathlib.PurePath``, or the separated path can be given as an
    iterable of ``str``, ``bytes``, and ``pathlib.PurePath``. Each part
    of a separated path is escaped using
    ``pathesc.escape_path``. Otherwise, the path is assumed to be
    already escaped. Escaping is done so that targets with a part that
    starts with one or more periods, contain slashes, and/or contain
    nulls can be used without causing the wrong Group to be looked in or
    the wrong target to be looked at. It essentially allows one to make
    a Dataset named ``'..'`` or ``'a/a'`` instead of moving around in
    the Dataset hierarchy.

    There are various options that can be used to influence how the data
    is read and written. They can be passed as an already constructed
    ``Options`` into `options` or as additional keywords that will be
    used to make one by ``options = Options(**keywords)``.

    Two very important options are ``store_python_metadata`` and
    ``matlab_compatible``, which are ``bool``. The first makes it so
    that enough metadata (HDF5 Attributes) are written that data can be
    read back accurately without it (or its contents if it is a
    container type) ending up different types, transposed in the case of
    numpy arrays, etc. The latter makes it so that the appropriate
    metadata is written, string and bool and complex types are converted
    properly, and numpy arrays are transposed; which is needed to make
    sure that MATLAB can import data correctly (the HDF5 header is also
    set so MATLAB will recognize it).

    This class is a MutableMapping, meaning that it supports many of the
    operations allowed on ``dict``, including operations that modify
    it.

    Example
    -------

       >>> import hdf5storage
       >>> with hdf5storage.File('data.h5', writable=True) as f:
       >>>     f.write(4, '/a')
       >>>     a = f.read('/a')
       >>> a
       4

    Note
    ----
    This class is threadsafe to the ``threading`` module, but not the
    ``multiprocessing`` module.

    Warning
    -------
    The passed ``Options`` object is shallow copied, meaning that
    changes to the original will not affect an instance of this class
    with the exception of changes within the ``marshaller_collection``
    option which is not deep copied. The ``marshallers_collection``
    option should not bechanged while a method of an instance of this
    class is running.

    Parameters
    ----------
    filename : str, optional
        The path to the HDF5 file to open. The default is ``'data.h5'``.
    writable : bool, optional
        Whether the writing should be allowed or not. The default is
        ``False`` (readonly).
    truncate_existing : bool, optional
        If `writable` is ``True``, whether to truncate the file if it
        already exists before writing to it.
    truncate_invalid_matlab : bool, optional
        If `writable` is ``True``, whether to truncate a file if
        matlab_compatibility is being done and the file doesn't have the
        proper header (userblock in HDF5 terms) setup for MATLAB
        metadata to be placed.
    options : Options or None, optional
        The options to use when reading and/or writing. Is mutually
        exclusive with any additional keyword arguments given (set to
        ``None`` or don't provide the argument at all to use them).

    package's ``scipy.io.savemat`` function, which this function is

    Parameters
    ----------

        Name of the MAT file to store in. The '.mat' extension is

    appendmat : bool, optional
        Whether to append the '.mat' extension to `file_name` if it
        doesn't already end in it or not.
    format : {'4', '5', '7.3'}, optional
        The MATLAB mat file format to use. The '7.3' format is handled
        by this package while the '4' and '5' formats are dispatched to
        SciPy.
    oned_as : {'row', 'column'}, optional
        Whether 1D arrays should be turned into row or column vectors.
    store_python_metadata : bool, optional
        Whether or not to store Python type information. Doing so allows
        most types to be read back perfectly. Only applicable if not
        dispatching to SciPy (`format` >= 7.3).
    action_for_matlab_incompatible: str, optional
        The action to perform writing data that is not MATLAB
        compatible. The actions are to write the data anyways
        ('ignore'), don't write the incompatible data ('discard'), or
        throw a ``TypeNotMatlabCompatibleError`` exception.
    marshaller_collection : MarshallerCollection, optional
        Collection of marshallers to disk to use. Only applicable if
        not dispatching to SciPy (`format` >= 7.3).
    truncate_existing : bool, optional
        Whether to truncate the file if it already exists before writing
        to it.
    truncate_invalid_matlab : bool, optional
        Whether to truncate a file if the file doesn't have the proper
        header (userblock in HDF5 terms) setup for MATLAB metadata to be
        placed.
    **keywords :
        Additional keywords arguments to be passed onto
        ``scipy.io.savemat`` if dispatching to SciPy (`format` < 7.3).

    Raises
    ------
    ImportError

    exceptions.TypeNotMatlabCompatibleError
        If writing a type not compatible with MATLAB and
        `action_for_matlab_incompatible` is set to ``'error'``.

    Notes
    -----
    Writing the same data and then reading it back from disk using the
    HDF5 based version 7.3 format (the functions in this package) or the
    older format (SciPy functions) can lead to very different
    results. Each package supports a different set of data types and
    converts them to and from the same MATLAB types differently.

        files).
    options : Options or None, optional
        The options to use when reading and/or writing, or ``None`` to
        use the default. If passed, it overrides the
        `marshaller_collection` argument. Only applicable if not
        dispatching to SciPy (version 7.3 and newer files).
    **keywords :
        Additional keywords arguments to be passed onto
        ``scipy.io.loadmat`` if dispatching to SciPy if the file is not
        a version 7.3 or later format.

    Returns
    -------
    mdict : dict
        Dictionary of all the variables read from the MAT file (name
        as the key, and content as the value). If a variable was missing
        from the file, it will not be present here.

    Raises
    ------
    ImportError
        If it is not a version 7.3 .mat file and the ``scipy`` module
        can't be found when dispatching to SciPy.
    KeyError
        If a variable cannot be found.
    exceptions.CantReadError
        If reading the data can't be done.

    Notes
    -----
    Writing the same data and then reading it back from disk using the
    HDF5 based version 7.3 format (the functions in this package) or the
    older format (SciPy functions) can lead to very different
    results. Each package supports a different set of data types and
    converts them to and from the same MATLAB types differently.
